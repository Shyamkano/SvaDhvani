# ==> WHAT NOT TO PUSH <==
# This file tells Git which files and folders to completely ignore.
# Anything listed here WILL NOT be pushed to GitHub.

# 1. Dependencies
# These are downloaded by each developer using 'npm install' or 'yarn install'.
# Pushing them would make your repository enormous.
node_modules/

# 2. Secret Keys & Environment Variables
# DANGER: These files contain sensitive API keys, passwords, and credentials.
# Never, ever commit these to a public repository.
.env
.env.local
.env.*.local
google-services.json

# 3. Build Artifacts & Caches
# These are temporary files and folders generated on your machine when you run or build the app.
# They are unique to your computer and will be re-created automatically.
.expo/
.metro-health-check*
.npm/
.yarn-integrity
*.tsbuildinfo
dist/
web-build/
coverage/
.cache/
.parcel-cache/

# 4. Generated Native Project Folders
# In modern Expo projects, these folders are generated locally when needed.
# Pushing them can cause major conflicts between different operating systems (macOS vs. Windows).
/ios
/android

# 5. Native Code Signing & Keystore Files
# These are highly sensitive files used to sign and publish your app.
# Leaking them would allow someone else to publish an app as you.
*.jks
*.p8
*.p12
*.key
*.keystore
*.pem
*.mobileprovision

# 6. Operating System Specific Files
# Junk files created by macOS, Windows, and Linux that don't belong in a code repository.
.DS_Store
Thumbs.db
ehthumbs.db
._*
*.stackdump
[Dd]esktop.ini
$RECYCLE.BIN/

# 7. Log Files
# Debug logs from npm, Yarn, or other tools. They are not useful to other developers.
npm-debug.log*
yarn-debug.log*
yarn-error.log*

# 8. Editor & IDE Settings
# Your personal editor settings should not be forced on other team members.
# We make exceptions for shared settings like 'settings.json' or 'extensions.json'.
.idea/
.vscode/*
!.vscode/settings.json
!.vscode/tasks.json
!.vscode/launch.json
